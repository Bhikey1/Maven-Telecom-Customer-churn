   Joined customer profile: Joined customers used only Offer E and mostly Month-to-Month contract.
   Stayed customer profile: Customers that stayed used Offer A, B, C, D and all the contracts: Two Year, One Year, Month-to-Month.
   There is similarity between the offers and contracts used by joined and churned customers, they both used Offer E and Month-to-Month contracts.
   While stayed customers' profile is different because they used mostly Offer A, B, C, D in combination with all contracts.
3. The key drivers of customer churn are competitors; they have better devices, made better offers, offered
   more data, and more download speed. Also, attitude of support person and service provider.
4. The company lost a little above 21 percent of high value customers. They can be retained by offering better offers such as Offer A, B, C, D,
   offering better devices, data and invreasing download speed. Furthermore, new customers should be offered other Offers and contracts except Offer E
